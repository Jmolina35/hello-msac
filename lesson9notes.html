    <h2 class="w3-container w3-pale-blue"> Lesson 19: Create a section clearly defining ways to write comments in JavaScript</h2>

    <p>What You’ll Learn in This Lesson:

        <ul class="w3-ul w3-border">

            <li>How to conceptualize different types of dynamic content</li>
            <li>How to include JavaScript in your HTML</li>
            <li>How to display randomized text with JavaScript</li>
            <li>How to change images by using JavaScript and user events</li>
            <li>How to begin thinking ahead to putting all the pieces together to create HTML5 applications</li>

        </ul>

        <p>There are two different types of scripting, which are server-side and client-side. Server-side scripting is when the scripts run on the web server and then send the results to the web browser. Client-side scripting, on the other hand, is when the scripts run on the web browser, and it has no interaction with the web server to run the scripts. There are a few languages that are for server-side scripting and those are Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby. JavaScript can be put in two places, either on its own file or within the HTML file.
        </p>

        <p>The Document Object Model or DOM is the invisible structure of all the documents, the DOM is not a tangible object. JavaScript should be unobtrusive when it's used, which means that it should be usable; if it fails, it should not show an error message and just disappear; the page in which JavaScript is being used should not rely on it to function; and lastly, it should be maintained separately. Images can also be changed depending on how the user interacts with the page. For example, when one is viewing a site that is like a catalog, there are various different pictures, and when the user picks one, that picture is the main one being shown.</p>

    <h2 class="w3-container w3-pale-blue">Lesson 20: List the Best Practices for JavaScript as a heading 3, and the listed bullets in an unordered list</h2>

    <p>What You’ll Learn in This Lesson:

        <ul class="w3-ul w3-border">

            <li>How and why to organize scripts using functions</li>
            <li>How and why to organize scripts using functions</li>
            <li>How JavaScript can respond to events</li>
            <li>How and when to use conditional statements and loops</li>
            <li>How browsers execute scripts in the proper order</li>
            <li>Basic syntax rules for avoiding JavaScript errors</li>
            <li>What JSON is and how it can be used</li>

        </ul>


            <p>In order to use JavaScript, one needs to learn and become familiar with its basic concepts and rules. For example, we need to know what a statement means in terms of variables. Objects and more. Loops are something that can be used as well. By being able to use loops, you can run the same code until you tell it to stop. This can be very useful, as it makes the code easier to read and understand. Another thing is an event handler, which is a script that handles events. This script runs when the event occurs in the file. </p>

            <p>There is a set of rules for which script will run first when there is more than one, since that is something that is allowed. It starts with the script that that is in the head section; next is the script that's in the body section; in the body, they are practically run in the order that they are written. Another rule for the JS is that it's case-sensitive and follows a camel style, which means that the first word is going to be lowercased, and the next word will be capitalized.</p>

    <h2 class="w3-container w3-pale-blue">Lesson 21: List properties for the document object, list Document Methods, list Basic Node Properties</h2>

    <p>What You’ll Learn in This Lesson:

        <ul class="w3-ul w3-border">

            <li>How the W3C DOM standard makes dynamic pages easier to control</li>
            <li>The basics of the standard DOM objects: window, document, history, and location</li>
            <li>How to work with DOM nodes, parents, children, and siblings</li>
            <li>How to access and use the properties of DOM nodes</li>
            <li>How to access and use DOM node methods</li>
            <li>How to control element positioning with JavaScript</li>
            <li>How to hide and show elements with JavaScript</li>
            <li>How to use JavaScript to add and modify text within a page</li>

        </ul>


            <p>JavaScript can manipulate the web browser and documents right in the web browser. It uses the hierarchy of parent and child objects, which means that a parent object is the one that contains other objects, while the child object is the one that is contained within the parent object. The document object has a few properties that can be used to get more information according to the properties, for example, there is one that tells you when the page was last modified or another that involves the site cookies.  Other objects that have properties of their own also include links and anchors, history and written, and more.
            </p>

            <p>Another thing that can also be done by using JavaScript is making layers to help with the positioning of items. Although with HTML and CSS we can position object by object where we want, it is also useful when you can position objects in groups. Besides this, one can also decide when one wants to hide or show objects.  The objects can vary from a border to full-on objects. One can also edit text by modifying it, whether it's by adding or replacing text or nodes.
